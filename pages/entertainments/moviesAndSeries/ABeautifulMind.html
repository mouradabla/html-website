								<em><b>&ldquo;</b>
									"A Beautiful Mind" is a <strong>2001</strong> biographical drama film directed by <strong>Ron Howard</strong>,
									based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel laureate in Economics. The film stars <strong>Russell Crowe</strong> as John
									Nash and <strong>Jennifer Connelly</strong> as his wife, Alicia Nash. The film depicts Nash's life from his early days
									as a graduate student at Princeton University, where he developed his mathematical theories, to his struggles with
									schizophrenia later in life. Despite his mental illness, Nash made significant contributions to game theory, which
									earned him the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994.
									<br><br>
									The film received critical acclaim and won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best
									Director, Best Supporting Actress for Connelly, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
									<br><br>
									The film was praised for its sensitive portrayal of mental illness and its ability to bring to life the complexities of
									Nash's mathematical work
